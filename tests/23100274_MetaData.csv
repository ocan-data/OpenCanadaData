1,"Canadian National, Canadian Pacific and CSXT define a week as running from Saturday to Friday. BNSF defines a week as running from Sunday to Saturday.  For an explanation of the different methods railways use to calculate these metrics, see the methodology document attached to “Weekly Rail Performance Indicators, Transport Canada” found under Related information.  Readers should use caution in comparing railways between each other prior to having read that document as data between railways is not always perfectly comparable."
